        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <img src="./assets/images/about.jpg" alt="Spices">
        <p>Many years ago, my grandfather was looking for a restaurant in Charlotte that reminded him of home, that gave him the same comfort food he remembered from when he was a child. After meeting my grandmother, he decided to stop looking and open up H-Thai-ML.  We continue to serve this community with the same love and respect my grandparents did and hope you enjoy your experience every visit!</p>
